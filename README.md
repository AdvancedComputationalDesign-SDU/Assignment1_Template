## Tasks

1. **Initialize a Blank Canvas**
   - Create an empty 2D NumPy array representing a blank image.

2. **Array Manipulation**
   - Use NumPy functions for slicing, indexing, and shape manipulation to create patterns (e.g., stripes, checkerboards, gradients).

3. **Introduce Randomness**
   - Employ NumPy's random module to add variability and uniqueness to your design.

4. **Work with RGB Channels**
   - Extend your array into a 3D array to include RGB color channels.
   - Assign different colors to different parts of your pattern.

5. **Visualization**
   - Display and save your generated images using libraries like `matplotlib` or `PIL`.

6. **Documentation**
   - Write pseudo-code and provide a technical explanation of your transformation processes.
   - Include visual diagrams if necessary.

## Exploring Advanced Libraries

While NumPy and Matplotlib are powerful tools for array manipulation and visualization, exploring additional libraries can enhance your capabilities and open up new possibilities. Below are two well established libraries you might find interesting to use in this assignment:

### 1. scikit-image (`skimage`)

**Description**:

- **scikit-image** is an open-source image processing library for Python. It provides a collection of algorithms for image processing, including filtering, morphology, feature detection, and more.

**Key Features**:

- **Image Filtering**: Apply filters like Gaussian blur, edge detection, etc.
- **Morphological Operations**: Perform dilation, erosion, opening, and closing.
- **Feature Detection**: Detect corners, blobs, and other features.
- **Color Space Conversion**: Convert images between different color spaces.

**Installation**:

```bash
pip install scikit-image
```

**Example Use**:

```python
from skimage import data, filters, color
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load an example image
image = data.coins()

# Apply edge detection filter
edges = filters.sobel(image)

# Display the original and processed images
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 5))
ax[0].imshow(image, cmap='gray')
ax[0].set_title('Original')
ax[0].axis('off')

ax[1].imshow(edges, cmap='gray')
ax[1].set_title('Edges')
ax[1].axis('off')

plt.show()
```

### 2. OpenCV (`cv2`)

**Description**:

- **OpenCV** (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a comprehensive library for computer vision and image processing. It supports a wide range of operations, including image transformations, feature detection, object recognition, and more.

**Key Features**:

- **Image and Video I/O**: Read and write images and videos.
- **Geometric Transformations**: Resize, rotate, warp, and affine transformations.
- **Color Space Conversion**: Convert images between color spaces.
- **Filtering**: Apply various filters for smoothing, sharpening, etc.

**Installation**:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

**Example Use**:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a blank canvas
canvas = np.zeros((200, 200, 3), dtype=np.uint8)

# Draw a red circle
center_coordinates = (100, 100)
radius = 50
color = (0, 0, 255)  # OpenCV uses BGR format
thickness = -1  # Fill the circle
cv2.circle(canvas, center_coordinates, radius, color, thickness)

# Convert BGR to RGB for displaying with Matplotlib
canvas_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(canvas, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# Display the image
plt.imshow(canvas_rgb)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```
